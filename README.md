# Packed Circle Dependency D3

This project is an extension of [Zoomable Circle Packing](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535) to represent the dependencies of selected bubble. I used buttons for representing each circle in the pack. On button click, the dependencies of the selected circle in the JSON are parsed and displayed according to their color codes. The dependencies are described as per their levels i.e. 

* Strong dependency - Level 2 - Red Color
* Weak dependency - Level 1 - Yellow Color
* No Dependency - Level 0 - Green Color
